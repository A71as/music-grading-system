# music-grading-system
Python based album grader based on User Input


This program developed with the intention of reviewing any musical album that the user inputs. The user inputs both the artist and an album created by that artist to select for grading. An album is graded based off of the user's score for each individual song, interlude, skit, etc. that appear on the album, which are then run through the MGS algorithm with the the variable k, which is based off of factors like album experience, story, experimental ability, or personal attachment, rewarded at the graderâ€™s discretion
